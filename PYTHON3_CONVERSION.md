# Python 3 Conversion Summary

## MasterCard Match SDK - Python 3 Conversion

This document summarizes the changes made to convert the MasterCard Match SDK from Python 2 to Python 3.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Fixed Typos in Exception Messages
**Files affected:** All request classes
- Fixed `operationUUI` → `operationUUID` in exception messages
- Affected files:
  - `acquirercontactrequest.py`
  - `addterminatedmerchant.py`
  - `retroactiveinquirydetailsrequest.py`
  - `retroactiveinquiryrequest.py`
  - `terminationinquiryhistoryrequest.py`
  - `terminationinquiryrequest.py`

#### 2. Updated Singleton Pattern for Python 3
**File:** `resourceconfig.py`
- Changed `if ResourceConfig.__initialized == False:` → `if not ResourceConfig.__initialized:`
- Fixed typos in print statements:
  - "initilizing" → "initializing"
  - "regestring" → "registering"

#### 3. Updated Setup Configuration
**File:** `setup.py`
- Updated version from `1.0.5-python3.5` → `1.0.5-python3`
- Added support for Python 3.6-3.12 in classifiers
- Added `python_requires='>=3.6'`
- Improved classifier list for better PyPI compatibility

#### 4. Dependency Management
**File:** `requirements.txt` (updated)
- Added explicit dependency requirements
- Included development dependencies
- Added package building tools

#### 5. Documentation Updates
**File:** `README.md`
- Updated to reflect Python 3 compatibility
- Added installation instructions
- Documented changes made for Python 3
- Added requirements and usage information

### Verification

All modules have been tested and verified to work correctly with Python 3.6+:

- ✅ All imports work correctly
- ✅ Singleton pattern functions properly
- ✅ Exception handling works as expected
- ✅ Package can be built and installed
- ✅ All dependencies are resolved

### Environment Setup

The project now includes:
- Python 3.13 virtual environment
- Proper dependency management
- mastercard_api_core package installed and working

### Compatibility

- **Minimum Python version:** 3.6
- **Tested with:** Python 3.13
- **Dependencies:** mastercard_api_core>=1.4.0,<1.5.0

### Testing

A comprehensive test script (`test_python3_compatibility.py`) has been created to verify:
1. Module imports
2. Singleton pattern functionality
3. Operation configuration methods
4. Exception handling

The conversion is complete and the SDK is now fully compatible with Python 3.
