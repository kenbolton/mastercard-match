# mastercard-match-python3-modified
* Current mastercard-match library install for Python 3 is written in Python 2.7. 
* This is modified to hopefully work cleanly with Python 3 interpreters.
* As of 8 December 2018, this is updated to mastercard-match-1.0.5 for python 3.5 and 3.6.
* **I own no rights.** Original packages contained *BSD* license from MasterCard.
